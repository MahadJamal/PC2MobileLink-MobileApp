# PC2MobileLink-MobileApp

This Mobile App is to recieve data from the PC throw connect USB Bluetooth. This project focuses on just the Mobile Appplication part of a much bigger project where we incorporate some hardware and firmware to finally emit message from the bluetooth i.e. (getting a message from desktop Application to Mobile application via a USB port, USB to Serial converter, Display module and Bluetooth module).

## Explanation of Components

The Mobile App recieves the data from the bluetooth module and processes it to display the data on the screen. Eventually some code will be integrated in the App to actually get information on the USB devices connected to the PC and than control the access to those devices via security encriptions and security checks. 

__The PIC micro Firmware part for this project is a serperate Repository.__

__The other end of the message is a PC Application which is also a seperate Repository. The Link to that Repository is [here](https://github.com/MahadJamal/Mulphine_PC2MobileLink)__
